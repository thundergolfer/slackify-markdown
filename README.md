# slackify-markdown [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/thundergolfer/slackify-markdown.svg?token=yHGWQ42iK2BPk1FjaUMc&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/thundergolfer/slackify-markdown)

Convert markdown into Slack's bastardized markdown

> ⚠️ **Warning:** This is my first Rust and it's an awful, hacky thing (but functional, atleast).

----

## Usage 

`CTRL-V` Copy the markdown you want converted to your clipboard. Then...

* **Mac OSX** -> `pbpaste | slackify-md | pbcopy`

... and paste it into Slack!


## Install

#### Homebrew

Easiest way to install on macOS is by using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

```
$ brew tap thundergolfer/homebrew-formulae
$ brew install slackify-markdown
```

#### Manual Installation

You can get binaries for OSX and Linux on this project's [releases page](https://github.com/thundergolfer/slackify-markdown/releases).

After downloading, you unzip the `.tar.gz` and move the binary to a place that's on your path (`$PATH` on Linux/OSX).


## Development

### Releasing

TravisCI is used to release _Linux_ and _OSX_ binaries each time a **tagged** commit is pushed to `master`.
